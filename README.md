## User Experience (UX) <a name="user-experience">

### Strategy 
  
#### User Stories
  
The website is targeted toward any who are interested in aiding humanitarian efforts and wish to support Eritrean Christians who are being persecuted as well as any who know nothing about the charity and wish to learn more. It provides information via Press Releases and introduction texts for those unaware of the situation in Eritrea. 
  
Using Agile Methodology, User Stories were created from Themes and Epics with [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Hasmelash95/release-eritrea/issues). Each User Story was marked with a label for prioritisation. Must do, Should do, Could do, Won't do. The latter are to be implemented in the next iteration (see future features). They were compiled as a result of lengthy discussion with the Director of Release Eritrea and potential users to establish what the target audience would be looking for in a site.
