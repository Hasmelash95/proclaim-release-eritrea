        <h2>What Is Release Eritrea?</h2>
        <h3>
            Release Eritrea is a global partnership of Eritrean Evangelicals standing in solidarity with
            the persecuted Eritrean church.
        </h3>
        <p>
            On May 22 2002, the PFDJ (the ruling party of Eritrea) ordered the closure of all churches
            not belonging to the Orthodox, Roman Catholic or Evangelical Lutheran denominations.
        </p>
        <p>
            On several occasions since then the Eritrean government issued blanket denials of the
            existence of persecution in the country stating that 'no groups or persons are persecuted
            in Eritrea for their beliefs or religion' and that people were 'free to worship according
            to their wish'.
        </p>
        <p>
            The unitary one-party presidential prepublic is considered by Human Rights Watch to have among
            the worst human rights record in the world.
